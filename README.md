Task 8 -We have 10 numbers 1-10 and one button. I want to delete those numbers but should delete only even numbers â€“ what should be the best ways to delete by clicking on the button. For eg: if i click on button then alternate number should be deleted.  
	Answer: My understanding about this question. I will get the array of number after the user clicked in the button. And all Integers number I will divide for 2 by % operator. If the rest is equal 0, so the number is dividible by 2 and it is even number

		HashMap<Integer, String> hashMap = new HashMap<Integer, String>();  
		
		for (int r = 0; r <= fileSheet.getLastRowNum(); r++) {  
			int key = (int)fileSheet.getRow(r)  
						  .getCell(0)  
						  .getNumericCellValue();  
			String value = fileSheet.getRow(r)  
							   .getCell(1)  
							   .getStringCellValue();  
			hashMap.put(key, value);  
		}
